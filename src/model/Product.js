 * Normalizing the comments data:
 * Since comment data is updated a lot then we consider referencing (normalizing) it.
 * Thatâ€™s because the database engine does more work to update and embed a document than a standalone document.
 *
 * Each time someone posts a Comment, we need to update the corresponding Product document.
 * The data can change all the time, so this is a great candidate for referencing.
